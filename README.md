I prefer working with clear systems, reproducible processes, and transparent code.  
If something can't be explained, it's often not well thought out.

My focus is on:

- Flatfile architectures  
- Self-hosted tools with as few dependencies as possible  
- Understanding systems instead of relying on framework tricks  
- Documented workflows that are still readable two years from now
